# Aerodynamics & CFD Portfolio

This repository collects the main projects developed during my **M.Sc. in Aeronautical Engineering** at **Politecnico di Milano**, with a strong focus on **aerodynamics**, **computational fluid dynamics (CFD)**, and numerical methods for fluid flow analysis.

---

## Areas of Focus

- External and internal aerodynamics  
- Subsonic, transonic, and compressible flows  
- Turbulence modeling (RANS and unsteady simulations)  
- Grid generation and mesh sensitivity analysis  
- Numerical methods for fluid dynamics  
- Post-processing and comparison with reference data  

---

## Tools & Software

Depending on the project, the following tools and languages are used:

- **CFD solvers:** SU2, OpenFOAM  
- **Pre-/post-processing:** GMSH, Fidelity Pointwise, Paraview  
- **Programming & scripting:** Python, MATLAB  
- **Version control:** Git, GitHub
